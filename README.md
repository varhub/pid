# pid
PID control library for Python

This library is the port and improve of my C++ PID control
exhaustively used under JdeRobot umbrella for control robots.

## Install
This module can be installed, added to pythonpath or just copied.

Recommended option:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.python_modules
git clone https://github.com/varhub/pid.git $HOME/.python_modules/pid
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/.python_modules
# you can add last line to .profile or .bashrc to avoid type it always
```
